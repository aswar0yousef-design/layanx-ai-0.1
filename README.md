LayanX is a security-first autonomous AI runtime foundation designed **currently as a local-first, single-device system**.

The present target is to run the full runtime on the user's own computer with local storage and local AI providers such as Ollama. Multi-tenant SaaS, remote hosting, and cloud deployment are future evolution paths, not current runtime requirements.

## Current architecture

- Mission planning and execution
- Risk, permission, approval, and capability enforcement
- Tool registry and guarded execution
- Verification, audit ledger, checkpoints, and recovery
- Model/provider routing and failover foundations
- Executable local Ollama and OpenAI-compatible model adapters
- Health-gated provider failover with bounded request timeouts
- Project isolation and memory boundaries
- Skill scanning and controlled enablement
- Storage abstraction and migrations foundation
- Tool Fabric: Browser, Files, and Terminal
- MCP Gateway
- Skills Runtime
- Project-scoped Memory/Context Fabric
- Bounded Agent Teams and repair
- LayanX Control Center

## Scheduler and event-driven missions

LayanX now includes an in-process Scheduler and Event Mission Engine:

- One-time, interval, daily, weekly and monthly mission schedules; calendar triggers accept an IANA `timezone` (for example `Asia/Muscat`).
- Bounded scheduler tick loop with duplicate-run protection.
- Opt-in bounded retry (`retry: {maxAttempts, backoffMs}`, max 5 attempts, exponential backoff). Only enable it for goals that are safe to repeat.
- Run history (last 500 runs) at `GET /v1/scheduler/runs?scheduleId=&projectId=&limit=`; runs cut off by a shutdown are recorded as `interrupted` and are not re-run automatically.
- Event triggers scoped by project.
- Optional exact payload matching for event triggers.
- Scheduled/event missions enter the same Agent Gateway and therefore retain permissions, risk controls, approvals, verification, recovery, audit, and memory.
- API endpoints expose schedule/trigger registration and manual event emission.
- With `LAYANX_RUNTIME_STORAGE_PATH` (set automatically by `npm run local` / `LayanX.cmd`) schedules and run history survive restarts. Schedules only run while LayanX is running; use Windows Task Scheduler to start LayanX at logon if jobs must run unattended.

## Dependency-aware task runtime

Task decomposition is now executable through a dependency-aware runtime:

- Independent tasks can run in parallel with a bounded concurrency limit.
- A task starts only after all declared dependencies complete successfully.
- Dependency results are passed into downstream task context as untrusted data.
- Failed or blocked dependencies prevent downstream execution.
- Task assignments preserve the selected agent and model metadata.
- Model routing is applied to the mission planner only when the selected model also supports reasoning; otherwise the planner selects a compatible reasoning model using the task/agent tags.
- Execution still passes through the existing mission gateway, permissions, risk controls, approvals, verification, recovery, audit, and memory.

Programmatic entry point:

`LayanXCore.executeTaskDecomposition(goal, projectId, maxConcurrency, projectContext)`

## Voice interface

LayanX now includes a voice layer on top of the existing Runtime. It provides microphone-friendly local UI at `/voice`, speech-to-text at `/v1/voice/transcribe`, text-to-speech at `/v1/voice/speak`, and voice provider status at `/v1/voice/status`. Voice commands are sent through the existing `/v1/agent/gateway`, so planning, permissions, tools, verification, recovery, memory, and audit remain in the same runtime path.

The first voice adapter uses OpenAI audio endpoints when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured. The adapter is isolated behind `VoiceService`, so a local STT/TTS provider can be added later without changing the mission engine. Realtime voice is available through WebRTC using short-lived ephemeral client secrets; the browser never receives the long-lived API key. Realtime function calling exposes `layanx_execute`, which routes project/system actions back into the existing LayanX Agent Gateway. Current OpenAI documentation also exposes dedicated transcription and real-time audio capabilities.

Open the local voice UI after starting the API:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/voice
```

## Local runtime

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the local runtime:

```bash
npm run layanx
```

Run the local API:

```bash
npm run api
```

Inspect local runtime state:

```bash
npm run doctor
npm run layanx -- check
npm run layanx -- health
```

### Local persistence

- `LAYANX_RUNTIME_STORAGE_PATH` enables durable JSON storage for local/self-hosted use.
- `LAYANX_DATABASE_URL` or `DATABASE_URL` can later select PostgreSQL without changing mission/business logic.
- PostgreSQL is an optional persistence backend; it is not required for the current local-first target.
- Runtime snapshots remain validated by `RuntimePersistence` before commit.

### Agent Reach internet research

LayanX can optionally use the upstream Agent Reach capability layer for bounded, read-only internet research across supported channels such as web, GitHub, YouTube, RSS, and social/community sources. Agent Reach remains an external local CLI; LayanX owns missions, permissions, approvals, verification, recovery, memory, scheduling, and audit.

See `docs/AGENT_REACH.md`. Configure `LAYANX_AGENT_REACH_COMMAND` when the CLI is not available as `agent-reach` on PATH.

## Local AI

Ollama is the default local provider path when enabled. The default model is configured by the provider configuration and can be changed through environment variables.

No production cloud deployment is required to use the current system.

## Quality gates

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run security:check
npm test
npm run release:check
npm run build
```

## Business Operations Layer
LayanX now includes a local-first Business Operations layer on top of the existing agent runtime.

Current capabilities:
- Durable local store/product/order/content/campaign/media state.
- Store adapters for Generic HTTP, Shopify Admin REST, and WooCommerce REST.
- Product publication with external-id tracking to avoid duplicate creation on retries.
- Social account/content/media records with approval-gated publishing.
- Scheduled content processing through a dedicated business tool that can be invoked by the existing Scheduler/Agent Gateway.
- Business operating analytics derived from local state.
- API endpoints under `/v1/business/*`.
- Business tools are registered in the same permission/capability pipeline as the existing LayanX tools.

Credential policy:
- Secrets are supplied through local environment variables only; never commit them to Git.
- Shopify uses `LAYANX_SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- WooCommerce uses `LAYANX_WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_KEY` and `LAYANX_WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_SECRET`.
- Generic commerce/social connectors use `LAYANX_COMMERCE_TOKEN`, `LAYANX_SOCIAL_TOKEN`, and `LAYANX_SOCIAL_PUBLISH_URL`.
- Store `baseUrl` must be the configured API base URL for the selected adapter.

The social layer intentionally keeps platform-specific OAuth/publishing implementations behind the connector contract; it does not pretend that an unconfigured generic endpoint is a native Instagram/TikTok integration.

## Future evolution

The architecture keeps project boundaries, storage abstraction, provider routing, tool isolation, and API boundaries explicit so the local runtime can later evolve into a multi-tenant platform.

That future migration should add tenant identity, tenant-scoped storage, authentication/authorization, quotas, billing, remote workers, and operational isolation **without changing the security contracts of the local mission engine**.

## Development principle

Stabilize and verify the existing local foundation before adding another architectural layer. Production or SaaS claims must be backed by executable evidence.

### Automatic Test Verification

LayanX can automatically execute the tests selected by Change Impact Analysis after L3+ modifications. The test runner is workspace-confined, uses the local project `tsx` executable without a shell, enforces time/output limits, and records test results in Audit and Memory. When selected tests fail, the Agent Loop passes the failure back to the bounded Autonomous Repair Loop and retests after each repair attempt (up to 3 attempts).

## Mission dependencies, autonomous retry, and failure learning

Mission dependencies are distinct from task dependencies. A mission may depend on other missions in the same project; dependency cycles and cross-project dependencies are rejected. A downstream mission remains pending until all dependencies complete and becomes blocked when a dependency fails.

API:
- `GET /v1/mission-dependencies?projectId=...`
- `POST /v1/mission-dependencies` with `missionId`, `projectId`, and `dependsOn`
- `GET /v1/mission-dependencies/:missionId`
- `POST /v1/mission-dependencies/:missionId/run`

Autonomous retry is bounded and conservative. Only recoverable transient failures on L1/L2 read/analyze operations are retried automatically. Permission, approval, scope, verification, and modification/execution failures are not automatically retried. Each retry receives a distinct idempotency key and uses bounded exponential backoff.

Failure learning normalizes runtime failures into categories and stores sanitized failure signatures in the existing project-scoped memory engine. Similar failures can be recalled for future planning without introducing another memory subsystem.

## Repository intelligence and safe code modification

Repository intelligence provides bounded project/file metadata and a dependency graph used by impact analysis and automatic test selection.

Safe code modification is transactional:
1. validate project-relative paths and protected directories
2. rebuild project graph and change impact
3. select affected tests
4. require explicit approval for high/critical impact
5. create a local backup
6. apply all requested files
7. run selected tests
8. rollback all changes if verification fails

Git branch isolation is available through the runtime branch manager. Autonomous branch creation and switching require a clean working tree by default and reject unsafe Git branch names.

Git APIs:
- `GET /v1/git/branch`
- `POST /v1/git/branch` with `branchName`, optional `baseRef`, and optional `requireClean`

## Autonomous commit and code review

After safe code modification, LayanX can inspect the Git working tree and create a scoped commit. The commit layer verifies the expected branch, rejects unexpected files when a scope is supplied, stages only the selected files, and rejects unsafe autonomous commit messages.

Code review is available before promotion:
- `POST /v1/git/review`
- detects potential credentials/private keys
- flags `eval()` and shell execution patterns
- reports changed files and missing test-file changes
- returns an approval signal without automatically merging or releasing code

Git commit:
- `POST /v1/git/commit` with `missionId`, `projectId`, `message`, optional `expectedBranch` and `paths`

## Security review gate

LayanX now has a deterministic security review layer:
- `POST /v1/git/security-review`
- scans the committed diff for credential/private-key exposure
- flags dynamic code execution and shell execution
- checks traversal patterns and sensitive configuration files
- flags plain HTTP and credential-handling patterns for review
- reports dependency manifest/lockfile changes
- returns `approved=false` for high/critical findings

Security review is intentionally separate from ordinary code review so a future PR generator can require both gates independently.
## Pull request generation gate

LayanX can now prepare a PR draft only after the current commit has matching code and security review results:
- `POST /v1/git/pr-draft`
- verifies head/base separation
- verifies both review gates are approved
- verifies both reviews match the current HEAD and branch
- generates a structured PR body with mission, project, commit, files, and validation status
- never merges or releases automatically
## Release state machine

LayanX now separates PR readiness from release readiness with an explicit state machine:
`DRAFT -> REVIEWED -> SECURITY_APPROVED -> PR_READY -> HUMAN_APPROVAL -> MERGE_ALLOWED -> RELEASE_CANDIDATE -> RELEASE_APPROVED -> RELEASED`.
Any gate can move the release to `BLOCKED`, and a blocked transition records its reason. The Release Manager verifies branch and commit identity before preparing a release. No merge or release operation is performed automatically.

Release APIs:
- `GET /v1/release`
- `POST /v1/release`
- `POST /v1/release/:id/transition`
## Runtime tracing

LayanX already had Observability, Audit, Event Stream, and Execution State; this layer does not duplicate them. `RuntimeTracer` adds only correlated `traceId`/`spanId`/`parentSpanId` data for execution chains, with bounded in-memory inspection and sensitive-attribute sanitization.

- `GET /v1/traces` exposes current traces to the local control/API layer.
- Tool execution now creates a trace span and records duration/status.
- Existing Observatory remains the aggregate operational view; Audit/Event Stream remain the event/history layers.


## Paid Advertising Operations

LayanX now has a separate paid-advertising control layer for **Meta (Facebook/Instagram), TikTok, Google Ads and X**. It keeps paid campaigns distinct from organic content, supports ad accounts, campaign → ad group → creative → ad hierarchy, launch/pause approval gates, local performance metrics, ROAS/CTR/CPA dashboard calculations, and connector-based synchronization.

### Local-only advertising credentials

Real advertising credentials belong only in the local runtime environment or local secret manager and must never be committed to Git. Configure the platform-specific advertising variables from `.env.example`.

The connector layer deliberately keeps platform endpoint configuration explicit rather than silently assuming an API version. This is important because advertising APIs change independently. Google Ads currently has the v25 line (including v25.2 released September 23, 2026), while Google documents campaign/ad-group mutation through its REST mutate services. TikTok's Business API exposes campaign, ad-group, ad, creative and reporting capabilities. The runtime therefore supports versioned/configured endpoints without hard-coding credentials or pretending an account is connected before its credentials are supplied.

### Safety

Creating drafts is a modification action; launching or pausing a paid campaign is an execute-level action and remains behind the existing approval/audit pipeline. The system does not automatically spend money merely because a campaign draft exists.

### Advertising API

- `GET /v1/ads`
- `POST /v1/ads/account`
- `POST /v1/ads/campaign`
- `POST /v1/ads/adgroup`
- `POST /v1/ads/creative`
- `POST /v1/ads/ad`
- `POST /v1/ads/campaign/launch`
- `POST /v1/ads/campaign/pause`
- `POST /v1/ads/insights/sync`


### Connection and advertising discovery

OAuth connections can discover native publishing accounts and advertising accounts through the authenticated platform APIs. Advertising discovery is exposed at `GET /v1/oauth/:id/discover-ads`; account binding remains explicit so discovery never silently creates a spending account.

### Production hardening
Business state hydrates from PostgreSQL when configured, scheduler definitions persist across restart, scheduler/event management endpoints require API authentication, social publishing uses platform-specific configured connectors, and content generation can route through the existing model router with local preference.

## Visual Flow & Agent Orchestration

LayanX includes a local-first visual Flow Builder at `http://127.0.0.1:3100/flow` when the API is running. It orchestrates the existing Agent Gateway, tools, memory, project isolation, approvals, audit, and recovery rather than creating a second agent runtime.

Supported blocks include Trigger, AI Agent, Condition, Tool/Action, Message, CRM, Human Handoff, and End. Active flows can receive WhatsApp/Telegram messages through the existing channel service. Set `LAYANX_CHANNEL_PROJECT_ID` to choose the default project for channel messages that do not carry project metadata.

Start it with:

```bash
npm run api
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:3100/flow` locally.

## Quran Publisher

The Quran Publisher is integrated as a guarded local automation. It uses the Quran Foundation source adapter, verse-safe 30–60 second planning, a rights/license gate, 1080×1920 FFmpeg rendering, an idempotency ledger, and YouTube/TikTok publication adapters. The agent tools are `quran.doctor`, `quran.prepare_next`, and `quran.publish_next`.

Automatic publishing remains **fail-closed** until valid recitation social-video rights and the required platform OAuth/API configuration are supplied. Enable the two daily slots only with `LAYANX_QURAN_AUTOSCHEDULE=true`.
